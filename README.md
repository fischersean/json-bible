# Bible JSON Data

Simple Python repo that contains the full text of the Bible in JSON-encoded formart (/exports/bible.json).

I dont know why this is useful for anyone but here it is. This is only used in a seperate app that gives you verses from the Bible corresponding to NFL scores.

There are no requirements, just pure Python std lib

## Credits

The original King James text of the Bible comes from ![sacred-texts.com](sacred-texts.com).
