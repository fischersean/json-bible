# Bible JSON Data

Simple python repo that contains the full text of the Bible in JSON-encoded formar (/exports/bible.json).

I dont know why this is useful for anyone but here it is. This is only used in a seperate app that gives you verses from the Bible corresponding to NFL scores.

There are no requirements, just pure Python std lib

## Credits

The original King James text of the Bible comes from [sacred-texts.com] (sacred-texts.com).
